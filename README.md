# _The Religious Tradesman_ by Richard Steele
**Modern English Version**

I picked up a copy of Richard Steele's "The Religious Tradesman" recently, and while it has been an excellent book thus far, it is a difficult read just because of the older style of writing. Since I am having to read slowly and mentally "translate" the book into modern language, I figured I might as well write my mental translations down and make a proper book out of it, so these important ideas might be more accessible to other people. PRs are welcome!
