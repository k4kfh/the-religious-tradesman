# Chapter 2: Of choosing a calling.

Now that we've considered the God-ordained obligation to a life of business, and the reasonable advantages of it, the question is: which business should you choose? Even at first glance, this probably appears a monumental concern, as so much of the comfort and happiness of an afterlife depends on your decision. For young people, parents or guardians often have a great deal of control over this decision, but even then, the natural inclinations of the individual are worth considering. There are essentially two requirements when choosing your vocation: it must be (1) lawful (in the Christian sense, not just the legal sense), and (2) suitable.

1. In the case of a young person and parents making this decision, both must agree to choose a calling that is lawful. To sin is bad enough, but to make a career out of sin, make money in it, and employ our lives in one continued scene of disobedience to God, is simply disgusting. Anyone with any flicker of morals or religion should be able to see that. The prospect of Earthly gain may blind some men, and carry them on in a sinful calling without a second thought. But it is often seen that God's wrath follows them, even in this life, by blasting their hopes and dreams, and causing wealth accumulated by vanity and gluttony to vanish. However, even if this is not the case, and a person content in their sinful calling seems to have a perfect life here on Earth, let us remember that God does not forget, nor lose the right to punish, sins that He chooses not to deal with in this life.

It's plain to see, unfortunately, that these days men are exceedingly liberal with their consciences. They make light of religion, as if it could be confined to a few hollow acts of outward piety, without having anything to do with their general conduct. In a time like this, it's difficult to point out some "criminal" callings without being ridiculed. But everyone must admit that any employment which lessens our reverence towards God, obstructs the good of mankind, or incentivizes sin in ourselves or others is certainly a criminal calling. The only lawful callings are those in which we can reasonably ask for God's blessing, and expect His favor and acceptance. In fact, this is a great way to judge our every action, far beyond our career choices.

2. Our calling must be suitable; it must fit us.
