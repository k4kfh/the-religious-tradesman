# Chapter 2: Of choosing a calling.

Now that we've considered the God-ordained obligation to a life of business, and the reasonable advantages of it, the question is: which business should you choose? Even at first glance, this probably appears a monumental concern, as so much of the comfort and happiness of an afterlife depends on your decision. For young people, parents or guardians often have a great deal of control over this decision, but even then, the natural inclinations of the individual are worth considering. There are essentially two requirements when choosing your vocation: it must be (1) lawful (in the Christian sense, not just the legal sense), and (2) suitable.

1. In the case of a young person and parents making this decision, both must agree to choose a calling that is lawful. To sin is bad enough, but to make a career out of sin, make money in it, and employ our lives in one continued scene of disobedience to God, is simply disgusting. Anyone with any flicker of morals or religion should be able to see that. The prospect of Earthly gain may blind some men, and carry them on in a sinful calling without a second thought. But it is often seen that God's wrath follows them, even in this life, by blasting their hopes and dreams, and causing wealth accumulated by vanity and gluttony to vanish. However, even if this is not the case, and a person content in their sinful calling seems to have a perfect life here on Earth, let us remember that God does not forget, nor lose the right to punish, sins that He chooses not to deal with in this life.

It's plain to see, unfortunately, that these days men are exceedingly liberal with their consciences. They make light of religion, as if it could be confined to a few hollow acts of outward piety, without having anything to do with their general conduct. In a time like this, it's difficult to point out some "criminal" callings without being ridiculed. But everyone must admit that any employment which lessens our reverence towards God, obstructs the good of mankind, or incentivizes sin in ourselves or others is certainly a criminal calling. The only lawful callings are those in which we can reasonably ask for God's blessing, and expect His favor and acceptance. In fact, this is a great way to judge our every action, far beyond our career choices.

2. The calling we choose must be suitable; it must fit us. Many people have been ruined by rashly choosing a calling that doesn't suit them. Those who choose callings that are far beneath their capacities and out of line with their gifts quickly grow discontented with them. Those who choose callings that are far above their capacities, and out of line with their gifts, grow discouraged, and often embarass themselves.

Therefore, consider the abilities of your body and your mind. As far as the mind goes, it's generally futile to toss someone of a dull mind, with terrible memory, shallow judgement, or uncontrollable passions into a highly creative, inventive profession (especially a religious one!). Although some such people have proved useful in church and in state, it rarely happens, and God's goodness in allowing them to succeed does not justify the foolishness of man in making such an ill-advised choice.

The Almighty God may do what He will, and we must do what we ought. We ought to choose an employee suitable for the employment. For a highly intellectual, creative profession, choose a highly intellectual, creative person. Going the other direction, it is a terrible pity to confine a brilliant mind to a dull employment! Why force someone to the oars who is more qualified to sit at the helm? Since God gives some people excellent abilities, it's implied that He intends them to use their gifts, by working in an area that capitalizes on their abilities. In Biblical days, God called men with audible words, but now God calls us by bestowing real, tangible, suitable gifts.

Our employment should also be suited to the strength of our bodies. If a person has a strong build and remarkable athletic ability, but an unremarkable mind, is well-suited for a laborious calling. Someone with a weaker build and a more tender constitution should be placed in a less physically demanding station of life.

Education and circumstance are also worth considering. A genteel, liberal education prepares a person for a genteel, liberal calling, if the rest of their situation lines up with this. A simple employment suits a plain education. But mismatching education and employment can create problems. It will require uncommon wisdom and humility for an ingenious, well-educated person to stoop to a low, servile employment, and not be tremendously unhappy in it. Likewise, those who have been tenderly educated should not be placed in extremely rough employments, lest their sensitivity and learnedness be lost.

The financial circumstances and fortune of a person are also worth considering in choosing a calling. It's silly to direct someone with a large fortune to follow a plow when they might be more qualified to fill the chair. But more often than not, people have the opposite problem. Vanity and pride lead people to choose callings far above what their finances and substance can handle, in hope of some imaginary, fortunate event which seldom materializes. Going down this road leads to great disappointment, and sometimes great financial ruin, leaving the person further down the economic ladder than before.

So here are some things to consider in order to make a happy choice.

1. Give it a lot of thought! It's ridiculous to make such a heavy decision without careful use of reason and thought. You'll probably be doing this for your whole life! Too often this decision is driven only by naive fantasy and whim. People promise themselves that they'll have a life of ease, honor, pleasure, and gain in this or that career. They rush into it, and because their imagination exceeded the bounds of any reasonable expectation, they are disappointed quickly, and regret their decision. Ask yourself, is the calling I am about to choose lawful, and is it suitable for me? Do I have the means to fit this end (not too little, not too much)? Do I have capacity to learn it, strength and patience to bear its burdens, and substance to support its expenses?

If you don't ask yourself these questions, you're like a foolish builder. You may lay the foundation, but you won't get much further than that, and you'll only end up with shame and sorrow. If you're fitted for multiple callings, it's our wisdom and duty to choose the one in which we may most effectively serve God and our community.

2. Listen to others! Consult people wiser than you, preferably fellow believers, and especially those in the same calling. They're the best judges in their own profession. They know all the ins and outs, the pros and cons, and they know what it takes to succeed in it. Their advice carries a lot of weight, if they really are judicious, wise, and faithful. Young people should convince themselves to bring their decisions to those who are older and wiser, and to steer their course by their advice. Additionally, if you should take the advice of the wise people in your life, make the right choice, and still are unsuccessful, people will likely be ready to help you! Your peers will see a man of wisdom and prudence and good character who is in distress, not a man of rashness who made a decision on a whim and is now paying the price. They'll have compassion and be willing to help you get back on your feet.

3. Don't choose a calling that might harm your soul. There are some callings which are not intrinsically unlawful, and may provide a good living, but are managed in a way that causes damage to the precious soul. They may be filled with temptation and opportunity for sin, making it next to impossible to keep living a faithful life.

There are also places which, from a business perspective, would be highly desirable, but are made destructive by managerial neglect and dishonesty, or the infection of evil employees, who are the bane of young people. You wouldn't let someone neglect or do evil to your livestock, so why let your children fall into a trap like this? Don't let their precious immortal souls be exposed to a hazard like this for some momentary gain. What good will it do a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?

Let your children find an employment where God is reverently worshipped, and His day is religiously observed; where the foolishness of youth may be under a healthy restraint, and they may be taught to live for eternity, not just for the present. If their lives aren't regulated by reason and Christianity, they'll as far from happiness in this world as they are from the hope of the next world.

4. Pay attention to God's providence. Seek His direction and assistance earnestly.
