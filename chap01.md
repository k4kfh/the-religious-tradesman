# Chapter 1: The Nature of the Life of Business, and Obligations to it.

The highest source of joy for a man, and his highest purpose, is to know, love, and glorify God his Creator, Redeemer, and Benefactor. But we are beings of made of both body and soul, clearly designed for action in our present state of being. Because no man can supply all his needs on his own, we are placed in mutual dependence. In short, we need each other, because we can't do this alone. Therefore, both reason and religion lead to the same conclusion: everyone who is able should spend their time doing something that is beneficial to themselves and to society. In fact, much of the beauty of the Christian life consists of our interactions with the people and things of Earth, and in acting upon principles of wisdom, goodness, justice, and integrity in our dealings with one another.

Our needs and our wants have created an endless array of possible occupations. Some people care for our bodies, restoring our health with medicine. Others defend people, or defend posessions, and in doing so promote peace and prosperity. Some aim to improve our minds with useful or entertaining knowledge, even religious and moral knowledge. While others, of endless varieties, are contributing to the comfort, convenience, and delight of their brothers and sisters.

> Heaven formed each on other to depend,
> As master, or as servant or as friend;
> Bids each on other for assistance call,
> Till one man's weakness grows the strength of all:
> And builds on wants and on defects of mind,
> The joy, the peace, the glory of mankind.
- Pope

Surely it is worth reflecting on the wisdom and goodness of God in equipping men for all these services, which suit the necessities and comforts of human life. Some men are endowed with extensive knowledge, others with energy and strength. God may give one man a penetrating judgement, and give another a curious hand, or a strong arm. He calls some to travel abroad, and others to labor at home, each contributing to the public good in their own way. In our Earthly bodies, every part and organ is placed where it is needed most, and each part is at ease and content. In the same way, the great Governor of the universe inclines us to choose, out of the endless array of tasks on Earth, what is most acceptable to ourselves and useful to our community. Indeed, He makes tasks which might be intolerable to some men seem tolerable, or even pleasant, to others.

The rich ought to remember that their comfort depends just as much on the poor as the poor depend on their wealth and support. The eye cannot say to the hand, "I have no need for you," nor the head to the feet, "I have no need of you." This knowledge should encourage the rich to treat the poor with tenderness, and reward them by giving freely.

It's obvious that everyone who is capable should be constantly employed doing something useful in life. Obviously, few people have ever spent an entire lifetime doing nothing. But a great many people spend most of their lives "playing." They work only now and then, with no rhyme or reason or discipline, simply acting on whims and fancies. This lifestyle will never lead us to the reason we were created. In order to learn why God created us, or in modern words, "find our calling," we have to find some business to make use our time, and embrace it wholeheartedly, doing it to the best of our ability. Divine wisdom scorns the disorderly people who either don't work at all, or meddle uselessly in others' affairs while neglecting their own. In other words, God dislikes laziness, but He also dislikes busybodies.

The wise Governor of the Universe has given everyone a proper place and plenty of work, a calling, and He will reprimand those who are trying to act outside their abilities, or interfere where they clearly don't belong. But since Satan and his demons present many sophisticated arguments in favor of pride and laziness, I'll attempt to justify our obligations to a life of useful work by making a few observations.

1. Reason and the natural order of things require it.
