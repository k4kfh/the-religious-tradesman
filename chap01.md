# Chapter 1: The Nature of the Life of Business, and Obligations to it.

The highest source of joy for a man, and his highest purpose, is to know, love, and glorify God his Creator, Redeemer, and Benefactor. But we are beings of made of both body and soul, clearly designed for action in our present state of being. Because no man can supply all his needs on his own, we are placed in mutual dependence. In short, we need each other, because we can't do this alone. Therefore, both reason and religion lead to the same conclusion: everyone who is able should spend their time doing something that is beneficial to themselves and to society. In fact, much of the beauty of the Christian life consists of our interactions with the people and things of Earth, and in acting upon principles of wisdom, goodness, justice, and integrity in our dealings with one another.

Our needs and our wants have created an endless array of possible occupations. Some people care for our bodies, restoring our health with medicine. Others defend people, or defend posessions, and in doing so promote peace and prosperity. Some aim to improve our minds with useful or entertaining knowledge, even religious and moral knowledge. While others, of endless varieties, are contributing to the comfort, convenience, and delight of their brothers and sisters.

> Heaven formed each on other to depend,
> As master, or as servant or as friend;
> Bids each on other for assistance call,
> Till one man's weakness grows the strength of all:
> And builds on wants and on defects of mind,
> The joy, the peace, the glory of mankind.
- Pope

Surely it is worth reflecting on the wisdom and goodness of God in equipping men for all these services, which suit the necessities and comforts of human life. Some men are endowed with extensive knowledge, others with energy and strength. God may give one man a penetrating judgement, and give another a curious hand, or a strong arm. He calls some to travel abroad, and others to labor at home, each contributing to the public good in their own way. In our Earthly bodies, every part and organ is placed where it is needed most, and each part is at ease and content. In the same way, the great Governor of the universe inclines us to choose, out of the endless array of tasks on Earth, what is most acceptable to ourselves and useful to our community. Indeed, He makes tasks which might be intolerable to some men seem tolerable, or even pleasant, to others.

The rich ought to remember that their comfort depends just as much on the poor as the poor depend on their wealth and support. The eye cannot say to the hand, "I have no need for you," nor the head to the feet, "I have no need of you." This knowledge should encourage the rich to treat the poor with tenderness, and reward them by giving freely.

It's obvious that everyone who is capable should be constantly employed doing something useful in life. Obviously, few people have ever spent an entire lifetime doing nothing. But a great many people spend most of their lives "playing." They work only now and then, with no rhyme or reason or discipline, simply acting on whims and fancies. This lifestyle will never lead us to the reason we were created. In order to learn why God created us, or in modern words, "find our calling," we have to find some business to make use our time, and embrace it wholeheartedly, doing it to the best of our ability. Divine wisdom scorns the disorderly people who either don't work at all, or meddle uselessly in others' affairs while neglecting their own. In other words, God dislikes laziness, but He also dislikes busybodies.

The wise Governor of the Universe has given everyone a proper place and plenty of work, a calling, and He will reprimand those who are trying to act outside their abilities, or interfere where they clearly don't belong. But since Satan and his demons present many sophisticated arguments in favor of pride and laziness, I'll attempt to justify our obligations to a life of useful work by making a few observations.

**1. Reason and the natural order of things require it.** There aren't very many people who are truly independent. It's also highly unreasonable to live your life relying upon others vocations without contributing something to society in return. And, to expect that sustenance should drop from the clouds without labor and care of our own is such an absurd idea that none are stupid enough to defend it. And yet so many people live this way, pretending to live upon providence, while they live in sloth, and do not exert themselves in some proper business for their support.

But regardless of a person's circumstances, the fact that God (who does nothing in vain) has given us the capacity to take action in the world plainly shows that it is our duty to use our gifts in a rational and useful manner. In fact, activity is so natural and delightful to man that even if there was a law requiring us to be idle, there's no doubt that many would willingly pay their fine in order to occupy themselves with some work.

**2. It is the express command and appointment of God.** Adam, both before and after the Fall, was placed in a state of action. Before the Fall, God wisely chose a calling for him: *"The Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it, and to keep it." (Gen. 2:15)* And God chose this in spite of Adam's perfect circumstances. If a noble birth, a beautiful estate, a loving family, and a mind well-suited for thinking was an excuse for a man not to work, Adam should have been the laziest man in history.

Even after the Fall, when labor was more difficult for him and less profitable, God instructs Adam, in the *"sweat of his face to eat his bread, until he should return unto his dust." (Gen. 3:19)* The command of God Almighty to Adam and everyone after him is that *"six days they should labor and do all their work." (Ex. 20:9)*

Thus, it's clear that we should fill up our time with some proper employment, from one season of religious rest to another. Notice how I didn't say "from one Sunday to another"? It's obvious that the obligation to work 6 days is expressed in general terms, and is bound upon us by the same authority as the religious observation of the seventh day.

But even in the New Testament, this command is unchanged! Under the gospel, men are *"[commanded] in the Lord Jesus Christ to do their work quietly and to earn their own living." (2 Thess. 3:12)*

Further, so that his rules might have more force behind them, Jesus has given us his own example. Before He begins His ministry, we find him laboring as a carpenter. If the Son of God Himself stooped to a vocational calling to teach us humility, diligence, and industry, how can we call Him our master if we refuse to follow in His footsteps? To be clear, I don't mean that everyone ought to take up carpentry, or even that everyone ought to work in the trades, but what is clear is that everyone should fill their lives with work that makes them into reasonable, accountable beings, contributing something to society.

**3. We are doing injustice to our families and to society if we sit around being lazy all the time.** God designed us to have deep love for our offspring, and this should motivate us to provide for them. But idleness and sloth get in the way of your family living comfortably and happily. And regardless of what people may say about religion being the reason for their laziness, the scriptures are clear. *"Anyone who does not provide for their relatives, and especially for their own household, has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever." (1 Tim. 5:8)* How unnatural is it when we see children who, because of their lazy parents, are poorly clothed and wearing worn out shoes? *[Writer's Note: I felt I could not accurately translate the last two sentences of this paragraph into modern words. I've written them here in their original form. PR's and suggestions are welcome!] "Or how can they rise up and call them blessed, who thus make them heirs to nothing but poverty and distress? Nor is the regard we owe to the public to be overlooked."*

Nobody should stand content as a "zero" in their generation, content to have contributed absolutely nothing. Instead, they should employ themselves to bless others, so much so that one day, their absence will be felt. How many people work to provide us with our needs and wants? How silly is it to think of doing nothing for society in return? The industrious bees drive the useless drones from their little community, and indeed those who refuse to contribute to the public good do not deserve the comforts and protections that come with being a member of the community. The ancient Greeks and Romans believed this; they believed that idleness hurt the morals of men, and was bad for society. They believed this so strongly that they appointed magistrates to make sure that nobody spent their time in sloth, and they severely punished the offenders.

It was even the custom of the Jews to raise their children steeped in manual labor, regardless of how well-off they were, or how fancy their education was going to be. Case in point, we find the apostle Paul, who had a sophisticated education under a great Jewish rabbi, working as a tentmaker. The same custom is continued in other nations to this day. *[Writer's Note: The original text said "to this day", although it was written in the 1820s.]*

**4. Our own safety and comfort depend on our work.** The busy person, like the bird in flight, escapes many of the traps that may ensnare the idle man. It's virtually impossible for a person to do absolutely nothing for any significant amount of time, and it follows that if you're not doing what you should, you're doing what you shouldn't. Thus, Satan can hardly wish for an easier target than an idle person.

The sloth of Sodom is said to be one of the causes of its great wickedness, and even David's criminal indulgence seems to have been preceded by idleness. But honest work subdues the pride, lust, and sensuality that sloth and laziness love so much. Non vacat ("I am not at leisure") is sometimes a more powerful weapon against evil than non licet ("it is not lawful"). And furthermore, think of how many health issues laziness brings (obesity, and even depression are made much worse by laziness), and how much good activity does for your body! It's clear that the lazy person doesn't get nearly as much enjoyment out of life as the industrious person.

In light of all this information, we can draw some conclusions:

**1. That a lazy lifestyle is wrong, whatever excuses may be made for it.** It's certainly wrong that wealthy, affluent people should believe they are excused from activity and employment. Why would God, in His infinite wisdom, require no service from those who He has blessed so much? Thinking that way shows great ignorance on how to properly use and enjoy such gifts. Great material advantages in life derive their value from the opportunity they present to serve God. Great resources are meant to do great good. But God's design for these gifts is perverted when we turn them into an excuse for sloth and luxury.

Even if your own circumstances are so good that you don't need to work to support yourself, there are plenty of others who could use some help supporting themselves, and besides that, some kind of employment is in the best interest of your soul. A thousand vices are produced by idleness. The human mind without exercise is like standing water, and soon becomes dirty and corrupt. A life wasted in laziness and inactivity will surely lead to regret when you come to the end of it, but a life spent in the cheerful service of God, and usefulness to all mankind, will make your living worthwhile.

Sometimes, people try to justify their inactivity with the excuse of spiritual devotion, but this is rarely a good excuse, even for wealthy people who do not need to work in order to eat. But this excuse is especially incomprehensible and vain when used by people who need money to feed their families! It is a gross absurdity to use excessive application to the external duties of religion in order to justify neglecting the duties of social and family life. People like this are living as if they were all soul, and had no Earthly body or Earthly concerns. Sadly, in doing so they allow their families and businesses to grow weak in their absence, while they are indulging the excessive passions of hollow zeal, of an inappropriate and mistaken piety.

But some may say, "I have tried to do business, but I haven't had any success." This is not an excuse either! Let these people use their disappointment as fuel, and exert themselves all the more, rather than using it as a reason for despondency. Even though other attempts have failed, one attempt may still succeed! So instead of sitting down discouraged, people who find themselves here should carefully seek out the cause of their unsuccessfulness, and try to correct it (whether it is rashness, laziness, lack of skill, gullability, or vices). Having done this, they should try their hand at business again, with greater caution, with more steady resolution and diligence, and with a humble dependence on God, the giver of wisdom and the fountain of happiness.

Some people may plead inability. Just take care that this is legitimate, and not imaginary. Nearly everyone God has given a reasoning brain can find some way to employ themselves, and an industrious mind will break through many difficulties, rather than giving up and standing as a nobody in the world

Of course, for those who are wholly disabled by real infirmities, God himself gives a release from labor. The right way to live in that state is to be patient and to submit to God's will, even though such a circumstance will always be considered an affliction by an active mind.

Here's a scary thought: the reason many people loiter away their lives is often that their bank account is too low for high, "honorable" employments, but their noses are too high for the employments within their reach. They want to live without labor, and enjoy the gain with no pain, and their unwillingness to action, not their inability, is the real cause of their indolent lifestyle.

**2. Parents should educate their children for a life of business and usefulness.** Rich parents shouldn't let their own wealth and affluence produce worthless children. In other words, they shouldn't spoil their children. If you are rich, the money you give your children without them earning it will only be fuel for their lusts. It will only make their foolishness more obvious in the short term, and their eternal ruin more inevitable. It is near-impossible for a lazy person to enjoy gratifying every desire that crosses their mind without being sucked into the sins of the flesh.

If you are poor, and you do not teach your children to work, you are doing them irreparable harm! You have paved the way to shame and misery for them, and you betray God's trust. But instead, if you teach them to do honest work, they might be happy in themselves, useful in the world, and respected by those around them.

With all this in mind, the young ought to be excited to apply themselves in acquiring useful knowledge, so that they may help their friends and be serviceable to mankind. Although wisdom and knowledge are hard to obtain, and frivolity and laziness may look fun right now, the payoff later in life will make the present self-denial worth it. Foolishness and need are easy to come by, but wisdom and wealth come only under the blessing of Heaven, by industry and honest work.

Now to the other end of the spectrum. If it's important to work at your Earthly work, how much more important must it be to work at your Christianity? How stupid is it to neglect Christianity, the great business and end of our lives, which our souls depend on? We should strive to become better bearers of God's image, and know that by a sincere faith in Christ, and a humble repentance towards God, we'll be sanctified and readied for everlasting glory. This should give us hope, and a hope that only grows as we grow older!

Diligence, care, and honest work in our Christian life will no doubt lead to spiritual rewards. It's that simple. If this was the subject of a lawsuit, even a child could be the judge! Such hope might light the spark of ardour and perseverence in even the laziest, sluggish minds, even those who are totally uninterested in any Earthly honor or wealth.

But how preposterous is it! These eternal concerns are overlooked. This vital, necessary business is neglected, not just by the ignorant, but even by men of business, who are familiar with hard work and diligence! Too many people rise up early, go to bed late, and eat the bread of labor for some tiny Earthly gains, but cannot find a moment to think of God and their souls, even though reason and the Word of God assure them that this neglect is destroying their eternity.

Oh, come on, you hard working mortals! are the unsatisfying, temporary pleasures and honors of this life worth so much that you don't need to worry about what will happen to you when this life is over? Consider your ways and be wise. May God teach us all to know the things that differ, and prefer those that are most excellent, and by His power and His grace make us wise and happy forever!
